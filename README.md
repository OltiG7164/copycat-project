Reflection: The reason I did this project is because it was to test my html and css. It was really interesting to tie everything together and to see how everything fits in. It was a huge process that took a lot of time and difficulty. What I learned from the project was that it's time consuming to do a lot of html and css. I also understand now that simple websites take a lot of time and code. It took a long time and eventually it paid off.
